The part that feels overtwhelming to me is figuring out where I'm supposed to start with this. I'm not entirely sure if I feel this way because of the lack of direction that has been given or the specifications that were. 
I would like to increase my confidence in this by seeing the direction the second option was supposed to take and hopefully use that to understand the type of expectations I should have for future objectives given to me like this.
