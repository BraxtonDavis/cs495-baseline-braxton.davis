- The programming languages I've used are java, python, jython, kotlin, and dart.

- The majority of coding that I have done has been for classes

- The largest program I've worked on was a program that compared the stats of two college football players' stats for a reason
- I feel the most comfortable writing code to utilize information from elsewhere (either from the existing code or from an external site/input)
- I feel the least comfortable taking an idea and figuring out what exactly that is in code
